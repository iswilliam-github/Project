###Explain the disparity between closing tags and self-closing tags in HTML###

Closing Tags: Most HTML elements require both an opening tag and a closing tag.
The opening tag shows the beginning of the element, and the closing tag signifies the end of the element's content.
 For example:
 <p>Hello</p>
<div>Welcome</div>

Self-Closing Tags: These tags end with a forward slash (/) just before the closing angle bracket (>). 
Self-closing tags are commonly used for elements like images, line breaks, meta tags, etc.

###What distinguishes inline elements from block elements in HTML?###

The distinction between block and inline elements is in their layout behavior and how they
interact with other elements on the page.

Block Elements: Block elements start on a new line and take up the full width available to them,
pushing subsequent elements to a new line. 
<div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <form>, etc. are examples of Block elements.

Inline Elements: Inline elements do not start on a new line.
They allow other elements to sit beside them horizontally. 
Example are; <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <input>, <button>, etc.
